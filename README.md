# my_message_broker_lab
A lab to test a message brocker local with ipc.

## Reasons
To learn better how a ipc connction works and test send message in a pub sub patern.
Don't fotget to use rm -rf because as it is a study Im using the path to conect, and as long the path exist the connection are already in use!
